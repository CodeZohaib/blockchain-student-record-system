# Blockchain Student Record System
The Blockchain Student Record System is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology to securely store and manage student records. The system provides a transparent and tamper-proof way to record student information, including their name, age, email, subjects enrolled, and gender.

# Student Data Management System

This project is a decentralized student data management system built using Ethereum blockchain technology. It allows users to store and retrieve student information securely on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Truffle
- Ganache

### Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/CodeZohaib/blockchain-student-record-system.git

### 2. Install Dependencies
       cd blockchain-student-record-system
       npm install

### 3. Start Ganache and deploy the smart contract:
        truffle migrate --reset
        
### 4. Update the contract address in (app.js) with the deployed contract address.
       var contractAddress="Add Contract Address";
       
### 5. Start the application:
       npm start
       
### Usage
   1. Enter student details and click "Submit" to store the data on the blockchain.
   2. Search for a student by roll number to retrieve their information.


### Built With
   1. Solidity - Ethereum smart contract language
   2. Truffle - Development framework for Ethereum
   3. Web3.js - Ethereum JavaScript API
   4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Frontend development
